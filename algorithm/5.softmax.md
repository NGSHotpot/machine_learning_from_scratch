# Softmax

Previously, we have introduced [logistic regression](https://github.com/chenxingwei/machine_learning_from_scratch/blob/master/algorithm/3.logisticRegression.md),
Logistic regression can solve the binary classification problem, softmax regression is a generalize of logistic regression that we could solve multi-category
classification problem using softmax.

Here is how it comes:
