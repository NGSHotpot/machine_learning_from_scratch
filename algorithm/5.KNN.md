# K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

## Introduction

Previously, we have introduced that the logistic regression can be used to classification problems, but only binary classification problems.
Logistic can only decide an input sample belong to whether to A-class or B-class, it can not used to classify sample into multiple classes,
A-class, B-class, C-class, etc, for example.

The most simple and direct algorithm for multi-class classification problem is the k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm which is based on the
proverb: "Birds of a feather flock together". 

## KNN algorithm

In KNN training process, the model store the training data together with corresponding labels (categories the data belong to), which is
quite simple.

In KNN testing process, for each input test sample, the algorithm find k nearest samples from the stored training data. Count the categories
of the k training samples. The most frequently appeared category is then assigned as the predicting category of the input test sample.

## Distance

When measuring the k nearest neighbors from the test sample, a specific distance should be defined in advance. Most frequently used distance
is the Euclidean distance. For example, if we have two points ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_1=(a_1,a_2,...,a_m)) 
and ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_2=(b_1,b_2,...,b_m)), then the Euclidean distance between the two points are defined as:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?d(X_1,X_2)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(a_i-b_i)^2})

Euclidean distance reach its minimum 0 when the two points are in the same position, and Euclidean distance has max infinity. The larger the
Euclidean distance is, the more far away for the two points.

Also we have other famous distances definations such as:

1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?PCC(X_1,X_2)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(a_i-\bar{a})(b_i-\bar{b})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(a_i-\bar{a})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(b_i-\bar{b})^2}})

Where 

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{a}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i)

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{b}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}b_i)

2. Cosine distance
