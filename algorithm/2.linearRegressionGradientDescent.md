# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

Here I will introduce the gradient descent algorithm and its application to solve linear regression problems with OLS loss function, then
I will extend it to some other loss functions such as L1-norm loss function.

## Gradient Descent

As previously show in ![linear regression](https://github.com/chenxingwei/machine_learning_from_scratch/edit/master/algorithm/1.linearRegression.md), we can solve linear regression  with derivatives. But many complex functions do not have an analytical solution, or they are hard and complex to solve through a mathematics way. Then comes for Gradient Descent, which can be used to solve minimize or maximize problems.
